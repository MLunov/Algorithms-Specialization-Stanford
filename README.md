This repository contains materials and solutions for [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms), created by Stanford University.
*** 
**Please make homeworks by your own and look in this repository only when you've already done the assignments. Anyway, it is in your interests if you really want to learn something**.
*** 
Specialization consists of 4 courses:
1. [Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms](https://github.com/MLunov/Algorithms-Specialization-Stanford/tree/master/1-4%20Divide%20and%20Conquer%2C%20Sorting%20and%20Searching%2C%20and%20Randomized%20Algorithms)
2. [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://github.com/MLunov/Algorithms-Specialization-Stanford/tree/master/2-4%20Graph%20Search%2C%20Shortest%20Paths%2C%20and%20Data%20Structures)
3. Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming[]()
4. Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them[]()
